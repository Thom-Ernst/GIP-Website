        <h3>IT-biography</h3>
        <p>My name is Thom Ernst, I’m seventeen years old and go to school at the Immaculata institute in Oostmalle. But that’s probably the only thing most teachers know about me… There’s more to me following an IT course in school than just an avid fan of computers</p>
        <p>I somewhat grew up behind a computer desk. Already at a very young age I used a Windows ‘98 computer with 512MB of RAM and a 20GB hard drive. At the time my pc could handle anything I threw at it, I was of course yet unaware of how fast computer hardware devaluates overtime. The first thing I properly did on a pc was play a game my parents bought for my older brother: Stronghold. Even today I sometimes still launch the game because it’s still pretty decent. But my interests were about to develop into something more than just those of a computer gamer. At the age of six I used my first version of Photoshop and what I made was a concept of a “world flag”, a flag which resembled that of the EU, yet I was not aware of its existence at the time so I just made a flag that had all colours of the rainbow with yellow stars for every continent.</p>
        <p><img src="../img/le_me.png" style=><b>Me at the age of 8 sitting behind a windows XP and windows 98 machine</b></p>
        <p>Some years past and we had another pc for home use, this one was probably 4 times as powerful so I made sure to make full advantage of that. I continued to use this computer from 2007 until mid 2012 when I got my first laptop, which was at the time the most powerful machine in the house. It packed a punch with it’s glorious 8GB or RAM, a 1TB hard drive and a brand new graphics card inside. It was the best fun I had in years. The best part of it all was that this machine was mine, free to tinker with, install programs on, no one to answer to but myself. It was about a year later when I installed my first virtual machine, a computer running a virtual computer. At first I had a hard time grasping the concept. But it taught me a lot of things along the way. Not long after I decided the old windows XP machine that had slowly gone into disuse was in need of a revive. This was the first time I opened up a pc to actually do stuff with it. Only through careful planning, observation and trial &amp; error did I manage to patch it back up with it running Windows 8. This however was a very slow process so after I had finished patching it up, my mother had already bought a new pc, brand new and much better than mine, so the old XP computer got left alone to wallow in self pity. </p>
        <p>That’s when I decided to make my very own server computer. So I did, I had learnt how to host servers some time before and now I was going to put it to good use. Eventually I managed to lend my mother’s computer as she had a laptop she used because it was easier, so there I had another brand new pc at my disposal ready for more experimenting and learning. I taught myself how to network, using cables to connect one pc with another in order to give them internet access without the need for a wifi receiver. During all of this I also slowly got into friend groups of fellow pc enthusiasts who all enjoyed what I enjoyed. I however decided that after my fourth year in ASO I finally wanted to do something else, which eventually turned into me going to this school and studying computer sciences. It’s a hell of a story that doesn’t sound so interesting on paper, but remember that it all started with me playing a game my parents bought for my older brother...</p>
